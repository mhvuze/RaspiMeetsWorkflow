Searches telefonbuch.de for the phone number that is provided and returns either some status message (i.e. "No entries found.") or fetches the matching vCard and offers the possibility to attribute an organisation to the contact. I use this in conjunction with Telekom HomeTalk since they don't offer caller recognition as of yet.
